This is a student project resulting from a collaboration between the Medicine Hat College and the Medicine Hat Food Bank. It is an app designed to streamline the following HR processes:
- hiring volunteers,
- managing volunteer information,
- scheduling volunteers
- reporting volunteer attendance trends and other analytics

This deprecated version is an ASP.NET Core 3.1 Razor Pages app. There is a [new version](https://github.com/cdmoss/hrmanager-blazorapp) using .NET 5 in development comprised of a Blazor WASM app and an ASP.NET Core WebAPI.
